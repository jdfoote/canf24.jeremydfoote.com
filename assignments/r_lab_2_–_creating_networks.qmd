## Additional Requirement

For this lab, I want you to also practice asking programming questions on Discord. As you work on the assignment, identify something that is confusing or where you get stuck.

Then, go to the #homework-help channel on Discord and ask a question. Practice using the syntax for posting code snippets - i.e., use three backticks (\`\`\`) before and after your code block.
